# Trait Performance Relationships

While the trait-based approach has taken an increasingly important role in plant ecology, some of its fundamental assumptions remain poorly tested. Here we examine three key assumptions: (1) that traits are good predictors of plant performance, (2) that traits are better predictors of plant performance than species identity, and (3) that ecological filtering operates on traits. We measure relative growth rate (RGR), ecophysiological traits, environmental variables, species identity, size and age of individual tree saplings from 24 co-occurring temperate tree species.
