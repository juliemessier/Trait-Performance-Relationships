Biomass5,Biomass from 2006 to 2011,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,This is a response variable = g/cm averaged over the last 5 years of full growth (2007-2011 inclusively)

Branch.Dry.Mass,Branch Dry Mass,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,means nothing
Leaf.Thickness,Leaf Thickness,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,"too correlated with LMA, so I excluded it manually - this one is of ecophysiological interest though, so we might want to consider including it back in."
Leaf.Density,Leaf Density,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,"dimensionally related to LMA and leaf thickness, so I excluded it manually"
C.N,Ratio of Carbon to Nitrogen,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,dimensionally repetitive with LCC and LNC

Kl,Conductivity per Lumen Area,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,"too correlated with Ks, so I excluded it manually"
Kleaf,Conductivity per total leaf area on branch,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,"too correlated with Ktwig, so I excluded it manually"
Biomass1,2011 Biomass (g/cm),0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,"too correlated with Bio5 - We could try it as an alternate response variable to Biomass 5, to see if the full model fits better. Since many traits are plastic, maybe they only predict growth of the last year?"
pcent.max.Bio1,Percentage Maximum of Biomass 1 Per Species,0,Exclude - Strong Covariance,Too correlated with X.max.Bio5 so I excluded it manually
