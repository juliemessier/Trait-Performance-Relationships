Feature,Label,Class,Notes

Estem,Modulus of Elasticity for Stem,1,"Modulus of elasticity is also called ""Young's Modulus"""
Etwig,Modulus of Elasticity for Twigs,3,We can ignore that one. It Modulus of elasticity doesn't make much sense in the context of a branch

X.Lum,Percent Lumen,1,
VD,Vessel Diameter,1,
X.Sapwood,Percent Sapwood,1,
d13C,Delta13C ,1,In leaves - carbon isotope ratio - reflects Water Use Efficiency
Biomass5,Biomass from 2006 to 2011,1,This is a response variable = g/cm averaged over the last 5 years of full growth (2007-2011 inclusively)
pcent.max.Bio5,Percentage Maximum of Biomass5 per species,1,This is a response variable
Symmetric.Competition,Symmetric Competition,2,These are environmental variables
Asymmetric.Competition,Asymmetric Competition,2,

North.Aspect,Northern Aspect,2,
East.Aspect,Eastern Aspect,2,
Elevation,Elevation,2,
Summer.Max,Summer Maximum Temperature,2,
Fall.Min,Fall Minimum Temperature,2,
Mean.Temp,Mean Temperature,2,This is the mean temp between June2012&Dec2014 (when ibuttons were in the field)
X.Canopy.Opening,Percent Canopy Opening,2,
SampleID,Sample Identification,0,
Species,Species,0,covariate of interest
Site,Site,0,covariate of interest
Tree.Age,Tree Age,0,changed to 0 - covariate of interest
Tree.Height,Tree Height,1,
julian.date.2011,Julian Date in 2011,2,This covariate is the date at which the leaf samples were collected - used to correct for phenological effects on traits
Branch.Height,Branch Height,1,This covariate is the height at which my branch sample was taken from the tree. Not really a trait. Used to see if it affected d13C values because some papers say it will. But it didn't in my data
SRL,Specific Root Length,1,
Root.Wood.Density,Root Wood Density,1,
Twig.branching.angle,Twig Branching Angle,1,
Hmax,Maximum Species Height based on Literature,1,species-level variable
Shade.Tolerance,Species Shade Tolerance,1,species-level variable
Drought.Tolerance,Species Drought Tolerance,1,species-level variable
WaterLogging.Tolerance,Species WaterLogging Tolerance,1,species-level variable
DBH.DGH,DBH:DGH,3,
Leaf.Area.Ratio,Leaf Area Ratio,3,
Branch.Dry.Mass,Branch Dry Mass,3,means nothing
Leaf.Thickness,Leaf Thickness,3,"too correlated with LMA, so I excluded it manually - this one is of ecophysiological interest though, so we might want to consider including it back in."
Leaf.Density,Leaf Density,3,"dimensionally related to LMA and leaf thickness, so I excluded it manually"
C.N,Ratio of Carbon to Nitrogen,3,dimensionally repetitive with LCC and LNC
C.P,Ratio of Carbon to Phosphorus,3,dimensionally repetitite with LCC and LPC
N.P,Ratio of Nitrogen to Phosphorus,3,dimensionally repetitive with LNC and LPC
Kl,Conductivity per Lumen Area,3,"too correlated with Ks, so I excluded it manually"
Kleaf,Conductivity per total leaf area on branch,3,"too correlated with Ktwig, so I excluded it manually"
Biomass1,g/cm of 2011,3,"too correlated with Bio5 - We could try it as an alternate response variable to Biomass 5, to see if the full model fits better. Since many traits are plastic, maybe they only predict growth of the last year?"
pcent.max.Bio1,Percentage Maximum of Biomass 1 per species,3,Too correlated with X.max.Bio5 so I excluded it manually
Total.Transmitted.Light,Total Transmitted Light,3,too corelated with % Canopy opening so I excluded it manually
